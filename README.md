Modeling timber volume on terrestrial sample plots.

## Description

Sustainable and productive forest management essentially requires information on the spatial distribution of timber volume. In the context of frequent biotic and abiotic calamities, these data are particularly valuable with respect to planning issues such as harvesting, forest regeneration, forest protection interventions or nature conservation activities.

Here, a model is developed to predict timber volume or the growing stock, respectively. It uses several metrics derived from remote sensing data as predictor variables that are suitable for modeling timber volume. The remote sensing data employed are digital surface models (DSM) or normalized digital surface models (nDSM, also called canopy height model (CHM)) calculated from overlapping aerial images using image matching techniques. The timber volume was measured terrestrially.
